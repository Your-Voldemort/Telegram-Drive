//! Uploads that continue where they stopped.
//!
//! Telegram stores a large file as numbered parts under an identifier chosen
//! by the client, and keeps the parts of an unfinished upload for a while. An
//! upload records which parts Telegram has confirmed; a later attempt for the
//! same unchanged source sends only the rest. The record lives in the
//! account's own store, so it never crosses accounts.
//!
//! Nothing is taken on trust when resuming. The bytes that would have been
//! sent for the confirmed parts are produced again and compared with a digest
//! taken when they were sent. If they differ, or if Telegram no longer has the
//! parts, the upload starts again from the beginning.
