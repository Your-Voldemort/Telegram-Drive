# Security Policy

Telegram Drive handles Telegram sessions, local file access, optional encryption, loopback REST/WebDAV services, signed application updates, and an optional supporter-verification service. Please report security issues privately and avoid exposing user data or credentials while investigating them.

## Report a vulnerability privately

Do not open a public GitHub issue for a vulnerability or suspected credential exposure. Contact the maintainer through [cameronamer.com](https://www.cameronamer.com) to arrange private disclosure.

Include only the information needed to understand the report:

- The affected Telegram Drive version, platform, and installation type.
- The component or workflow involved.
- A concise impact description and reproducible steps using test data.
- Relevant logs or screenshots after removing private information.
- Any safe mitigation you have already confirmed.

Never send Telegram API credentials, login codes, session data, phone numbers, file contents, private filenames or paths, proxy passwords, REST API keys, WebDAV capability links, share-link passwords, vault/file passphrases, recovery bundles, supporter recovery codes, payment credentials, raw entitlement tokens, device private keys, signing keys, or production service secrets.

## Responsible testing

- Test only with accounts, devices, services, and data you own or have explicit permission to use.
- Use isolated test files for encryption research. The TDENC2 encryption feature is a frozen-format beta and has not received an independent security audit.
- Do not perform live PayPal transactions, entitlement revocations, signing-key changes, production deployments, or production D1 mutations without explicit repository-owner authorization.
- Do not expose Telegram Drive's loopback REST, WebDAV, streaming, or share-link ports to a LAN or the public internet.
- Stop testing if it could access another person's account or data, interrupt a service, or destroy data.

## Public bug reports

Non-sensitive reliability and usability issues can be reported through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/caamer20/Telegram-Drive/issues). Before posting, remove identifiers, private filenames, paths, file contents, credentials, payment information, and recovery material.

For the application's data handling and local-server model, read the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md), [REST API reference](REST_API_Documentation.md), and [WebDAV guide](WEBDAV_GUIDE.md). Maintainers changing the supporter path must also preserve the [$5 lifetime supporter license invariants](SUPPORTER_LICENSE_INVARIANTS.md).

See [TDENC2 format and review boundaries](Docs/TDENC2_FORMAT.md) and the [recovery drill](Docs/ENCRYPTION_RECOVERY_DRILL.md). Independent cryptographic review remains an owner-commissioned release boundary.

## Release provenance

After downloading a release artifact, compare its SHA-256 with the same release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`, then run `gh attestation verify ./ARTIFACT --repo caamer20/Telegram-Drive`. Inspect the verified workflow and tag/ref for the intended release. Refuse installation if verification fails or identifies an unexpected producer. See the [release-notes template](Docs/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md). Preflight accepts `--verify-attestation FILE --attestation-repo OWNER/REPO`; no published artifact verification has been run for this tree.
